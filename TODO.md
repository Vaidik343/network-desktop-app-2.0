# Dasscom IP Phone API Login Fix

## Current Issues
- Login API called with POST method but endpoint format suggests GET with query parameters
- 401 Unauthorized errors in subsequent API calls (fetchSystemInfo, fetchSvnVersion, fetchIpAddress)
- Session cookies not being set properly or not sent in subsequent requests

## TODO Steps
- [x] Analyze login API endpoint format and expected request method
- [x] Modify login function to use correct HTTP method (GET vs POST)
- [x] Verify cookie handling and session management
- [x] Add better error handling and logging for login response
- [x] Add detailed logging to all API fetch functions for debugging
- [x] Add success alert when login works
- [x] Fix Node.js headers.raw() issue for cookie extraction
- [x] Test login flow in Electron app with device IP: 192.168.1.208 âœ… SUCCESS
- [x] Add fallback authentication mechanism (Basic Auth)
- [x] Implement automatic fallback from cookie auth to basic auth for all APIs
- [x] Verify cookies are stored and sent in subsequent API requests
- [x] Confirm subsequent API calls work without 401 errors (with fallback)
- [x] Fix module export issue for fetchSystemInfoWithAuth function
- [x] Update all API functions to use Basic Auth directly (no cookies needed)
- [x] Remove unused cookie store and fallback functions
- [x] Fix login method to use POST as per API documentation
- [x] Fix clearSession reference error preventing app startup
- [x] Fix preload.js clearSession reference causing API response display issues
- [x] Add interactive API buttons in device modal
- [x] Implement individual API endpoint calling and response display
- [x] Fix JSON response text color to black for better visibility
- [x] Modify modal to automatically display all API data side by side when clicking device
- [x] Increase modal width to modal-xl for better display of side-by-side API data
- [x] Integrate all Dasscom IP phone APIs (DNS, Gateway, Netmask, Account Status, Call Status, All Account Info, Restart, Reset, Call, Answer, Send Message, Change Volume, Press Key)

## Files to Edit
- api/dasscomClient.js (login function and session management)
- main.js (if needed for token handling)

## Follow-up Steps
- [x] Confirmed actual device IP: 192.168.1.208
- [x] APIs tested and working in Postman
- Test login flow in Electron app with the device IP
- Verify login API response and cookie storage in console logs
- Confirm subsequent API calls work without 401 errors in the app
- Monitor enhanced logging for debugging information
